# :woman_student: Student website :man_student:

Main goal : create a website that contains student articles by using <strong>PHP</strong> for the first time ! (we will use lorem ipsum, our goal here is to improve by using PHP)

## Table of contents

- [The challenge](#the-challenge)
- [My process](#my-process)

## The challenge : 

- start with the HTML
- create CSS
- responsive design not supported, it's a PHP training
- use PHP to use dynamic datas, factorize the code.

Goals : 
- Use templates (.php.tpl) and factorize the code
- Use array that contains all data's articles (we'll learn databases later)
- Use array that contains all pages URL ('plan du site', 'mentions legales' & 'contact')
- Use strtotime() and date() functions to convert date format

To summarize, use will be able to :
- read any article by clicking on the desire article on the home page
- read other pages like 'plan du site' and 'mentions legales'
- send a form on the 'contact' page using get method (we won't manage the backend part here, we just display user datas after the form has been submitted successfully)

## My process :

<strong>Built with </strong>
