## Features

### <em>Headers</em> :

- we must display a logo, when you click on this logo, you return to the home page
- the menu allows navigation on the main pages: reception, seasonal recipes, starters, main courses, desserts

### <em>Footers</em> :

- display links to the 'contact', 'legal notice', 'send us your recipe' pages
- we must find a small paragraph summarizing the foundations of the site in general. Can be useful for referencing (SEO)

### <em>On the home page</em> : 

- we must find a small paragraph likely to change on a weekly basis
-  we must find a link to a recipe at random. Each time we refresh the home page, we display a different recipe
- display a list of the 5 most recent recipes
- display a list of the top 5 rated recipes

### <em>On the recipe page</em> : 

- we must see the list of ingredients of the recipe
- we must see the steps of the recipe identified by numbers

## The challenge : 

- start by creating the <em>wireframes</em> for the home page and the recipe page. To manage responsive, 3 formats are expected : mobile, tablet and desktop. 

- write <em>user stories</em> (use feature section above)
