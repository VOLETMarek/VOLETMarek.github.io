# 🚗 Trip Time 🚗

Main goal : create the foundation of a travel website and practice <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

- [My process](#my-process)

## The challenge : 

- start with the HTML
- create CSS and use variables for colors
- by using JS, we have to manage : 
    - 🌑 Dark and ☀️ light modes. This will change the body element to dark or light. We'll use localstorage for a better user experience
    - 🎨 Color theme. This will change the color of logo, slide and darl/light mode buttons (red, blue or green). Once again, we'll use localstorage for better UX
    - 🌄 Slider section. It should allow scrolling through images
    - 📪 Newsletter section. Display a newsletter container when we click on the newsletter button. Then, we want to display a success/error message if the user has used a disposable email. (We will store disposable emails that we have chosen in an array)
    - 💚 Like buttons on cards. We don't have a login system yet. The goal here is to display something like 'vous devez vous connecter pour liker !' when we click on it.
    - ⭐️ Comments section. Comments have a number of stars between 1 and 3. The goal here is to show or hide comments based on which checkbox we clicked. For example, if we check 2 stars box (and no other), it will only display 2-star comments
