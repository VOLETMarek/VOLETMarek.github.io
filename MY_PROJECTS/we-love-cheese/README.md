Main goal : we want to code a FAQ for our site, and practice <strong>JavaScript</strong> !

## Table of contents

- [The challenge](#the-challenge)
- [My process](#my-process)

## The challenge : 

- start with the HTML
- create CSS (ne need to support responsive, we'll take care of it later, the goal here is to focus on practicing JS)
- by using JS : 
    - when we click on a title (h2), all the other title's content close and the one i clicked on opens.
    - when we open a title's content, we want the title's arrow pointing down
    - when we close a title's content by opening another one, we want the closed title arrow pointing right
    - ne need to manage the case where no title is open
